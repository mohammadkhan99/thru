# Push to GitHub Commands

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/mohammadkhan/Desktop/Personal/Thru
git remote add origin https://github.com/mohammadkhan99/thru-landing.git
git push -u origin main
```

If you named your repository something other than "thru-landing", replace it in the URL above.
